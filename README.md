# Placeholder: AI-Powered Defect Detection App

## Mission Statement
> Transforming additive manufacturing through autonomous, closed-loop monitoring that turns machine failures into instant alerts and actionable fleet data.

## Details
**Placeholder** is an AI-powered process monitoring platform designed to help manufacturers, teams, and hobbyists eliminate 3D printing failures in real-time. Rather than relying on manual supervision or post-print inspection, Placeholder uses a multi-camera computer vision system to continuously assess the health of a print. 

The system tracks the physical layer against the intended G-code path, identifying defects in the machine’s execution (such as warping, spaghetti, or under-extrusion) as they happen. Through the Placeholder web platform, authenticated users can monitor their machines via a real-time livestream feed, complete with a dynamic "Print Health" confidence percentage bar. When the AI's confidence drops below a safe threshold, the system triggers an emergency stop and immediately dispatches an email notification. 

Built with scalability in mind, Osiris-AM features robust Organization management. Users can join teams to view each other's live printing feeds, analyze fleet-wide statistics, and subscribe to shared error notifications, making it the perfect tool for makerspaces, university labs, and industrial print farms.

## Unique Features
* **Real-Time Print Dashboard:** Monitor your prints with a live camera feed and a dynamic AI confidence percentage bar indicating current print health.
* **Instant Email Notifications:** Secure user authentication linked to an automated alert system that emails you the moment a defect is detected.
* **Organization & Team Hub:** Create or join organizations to share live camera feeds, track fleet-wide print statistics, and manage collaborative printing workflows.
* **Multi-Camera Vision Mesh:** Scalable support for multiple angles to eliminate nozzle occlusion and monitor large-scale industrial printers.
* **Defect Detection:** Real-time identification of "Spaghetti," "Warping," and "Delamination" using high-speed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
* **Autonomous Intervention:** Automatic "Emergency Stop" triggers via OctoPrint when catastrophic failures occur.

## Tech Stack
* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
* **Frontend:** Next.js / Node.js
* **Database & Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Row Level Security)
* **Local AI Platform:** Ollama (Llama 3 / Mistral)
* **Control Interface:** OctoPrint API

## Getting Started

> **Note:** Please ensure you have [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed before setup.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Set up environment variables**
    Look at `.env.example` in the backend directory and create a new file named `.env`. Add the correct variables (OctoPrint API keys, Supabase credentials, Email SMTP settings, etc.).

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3.  **Create & Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Return to Root Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

6.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Environment variable set up:**
    Create a new file named `.env.local` in the `frontend/osiris` directory and add correct variables from `.env.example`. Change the backend URL to your local backend URL if needed.

2.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend/osiris
    ```

3.  **Install Packages & Launch Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
